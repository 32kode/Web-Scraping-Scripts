# decisionMakerTool

What this tool does.
This tool is used to fetch decision makers information from Finnish companies. 
The tool takes finnish company IDs and exports the decision maker names as well as positions in the company.

Backend code of this tool works as intended but the front end refinment is still a work in progress, soon to be updated.
